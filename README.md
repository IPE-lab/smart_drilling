## In `RISK` file, involved the CNN feature extraction of logging data, followed by LSTM to effectively predict and classify downhole conditions into four categories



## In `ROP` file, a GBDT-LSTM model is constructed, which incorporates neighboring well assistance, successfully achieving predictive drilling ROP within the same well.
