## LstmCnnModel Documentation

The `LstmCnnModel` is a Python class that implements a classification model based on a hybrid long short-term memory-convolutional neural network (LSTM-CNN) architecture.

### Functions
- `__init__(self, path_train, path_predict, learning_rate=0.001, beta_1=0.9, beta_2=0.999, epsilon=1e-08, weight_decay=1e-4, num_lstm_layers=2, lstm_hidden_size=16, cnn_num_units=128, num_epochs=5, validation_split_ratio=0.1, batch_size=128)`: Initializes the LstmCnnModel class by setting various parameters and hyperparameters for the neural network model.
- `_load_data(self)`: Loads the dataset specified by the file paths provided in `__init__()`, preprocesses it, and stores it in instance variables.
- `_build_model(self)`: Constructs an LSTM-CNN hybrid model in Tensorflow 2.0, which is the backbone of the LstmCnnModel object.
- `train(self)`: Trains the LSTM-CNN model using the training data provided in `__init__()`.
- `predict(self)`: Predicts the labels of new data using the trained LSTM-CNN model.

### Usage
To use the LSTM-CNN model, you first need to create an instance of the LstmCnnModel class by specifying your training and prediction dataset paths as well as any other hyperparameters you want to set. Then, you can call the `train()` function to train the model and the `predict()` function to obtain predictions from new data.

```python
path_train='train_data.xlsx'
path_predict='test_data.xlsx'

model = LstmCnnModel(path_train path_predict,learning_rate=0.001, lstm_hidden_size=32, num_epochs=10)
model.train()
predictions = model.predict()

print(predictions)
```

### Limitations
- The LSTM-CNN model can be computationally expensive and may not be suitable for very large datasets or low-resource systems.
- The user must provide the training and testing datasets in a specific format (i.e., as an Excel file with a certain number of columns and specific headers) for this implementation to work properly. Users with different types of datasets will need to modify the code accordingly. 
- The hyperparameters used by the model may not be optimal for all problems, so users may need to experiment with different combinations of hyperparameters to obtain the best results.
