## In `RISK` file, involved the CNN feature extraction of logging data, followed by LSTM to effectively predict and classify downhole conditions into four categories



## In `ROP` file, a GBDT-LSTM model is constructed, which incorporates neighboring well assistance, successfully achieving predictive drilling ROP within the same well.



## The `GBDTModel` class is a Python implementation of a gradient boosting regression model that includes various methods for reading data, training the model, making predictions, and visualizing the results.
